# Energy_efficiency_optimization_for_MIMO_interference_networks
Solving energy efficiency optimazation problem for MIMO interference wireless network using iterative semi-definite programming with WMMSE (SDP-WMMSE) algorithm and successive convex approximaion (SCA) algorithm   
  
To run the code, the CVX package is needed
